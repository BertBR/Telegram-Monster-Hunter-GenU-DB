# Telegram-Monster-Hunter-GenUdb

First all, I'm a big fan of Monster Hunter Franchise. I was searching for an API to "_oldschool_" monster hunter games like 4u,xx/genU but I can't found anything. So I decided to do something by myself...

This bot uses the [MHGENU-DB](https://github.com/gatheringhallstudios/MHGenDatabase) as data source. Any incorrect data should be reported to his owner, not for me!

## Features

This bot has two basic commands:

`/monster monstername` - to show Monster Weaknesses

`/drop monstername <L|HR|G>` - to show Monster droplist based on specified Rank
